# Day 6: Metabolic pathway analysis

## Investigating metabolic pathways

To investigate the pathways further we will use a tool from KEGG called "KEGG mapper". For this:

* Download to your computer the file `kegg_ids.txt`.
* Go to https://www.genome.jp/kegg/mapper/search.html
* Copy and paste the file in the box
* In "Search mode", select **Reference**
* Click "Exec"
* Find the pathway you want to investigate further and click on it.
* See the genes involved in the pathway. Genes showed in red are the ones found in our genome. Everything else was not (well, at least was not annotated). Do you think that the cell would be able to carry out this pathway?

By looking at the different metabolic pathways encoded by our genome, let's try to answer:

* How does the strain
  * Gets energy
  * Gets carbon and nitrogen
  * Survives in stress
  * Move around

This will be a collaborative effort. Once you found something interesting, add it to our metabolic map [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YgfunCfAhrPy1pcNvLfgUGHzgj_fYwcIyQ88bVbcv8I/edit?usp=sharing).  
Feel free to add addtional headers if you find something interesting.
